Bankist Website

The Bankist Website is a frontend prototype for a fictional banking app, showcasing responsive design, smooth user interactions, and modern JavaScript features.

Techniques and Features
- Intersection Observer: Implements lazy-loading for images ([MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)).
- CSS Scroll Snap: Creates a smooth scrolling effect on sections ([CSS Scroll Snap on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap)).

Technologies and Libraries
- Normalize.css: Ensures cross-browser consistency ([Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)).
- Google Fonts: Uses [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) for modern typography.
